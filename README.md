# Customer Segmentation using K-Means (C++)

This project implements **K-Means clustering from scratch in C++** to group bank customers based on their **Income** and **Spending Score**.  
It demonstrates algorithmic understanding of unsupervised learning without external ML libraries.

## 🚀 Features
- Implements K-Means clustering step-by-step (assignment + update)
- Loads input data from CSV
- Outputs final clusters and centroids
- Example dataset included (`customers.csv`)

## 🖥️ Example Output
Final Clusters:
Customer 1 (Income=15, Spending=39) -> Cluster 0
Customer 2 (Income=16, Spending=81) -> Cluster 1
...
Centroids:
Cluster 0: Income=22.2, Spending=27
Cluster 1: Income=18, Spending=78
Cluster 2: Income=35, Spending=75
